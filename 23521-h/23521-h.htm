<div class="cpoem">
<p>
Long, long ago, in ancient times, there lived a King and Queen,<br />
And for the blessing of a child their longing sore had been:<br />
At last, a little daughter fair, to their great joy, was given,<br />
And to the christening feast they made, they bade the Fairies seven&mdash;<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/illus-0006-1.jpg" width="491" height="650" alt="" title="THE SLEEPING BEAUTY" />
</div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
The Fairies seven, who loved the land&mdash;that they the child might bless,<br />
Yet one old Fairy they left out, in pure forgetfulness.<br />
And at the feast, the dishes fair were of the reddest gold;<br />
But when the Fairy came, not one for her, so bad and old,<br />
Angry was she, because her place and dish had been forgot,<br />
And angry things she muttered long, and kept her anger hot.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/illus-0009-1.jpg" width="491" height="650" alt="" title="THE SLEEPING BEAUTY" />
</div>

<div class="cpoem"><p>
Until the Fairy godmothers their gifts and wishes gave:<br />
She waited long to spoil the gifts, and her revenge to have.<br />
One gave the Princess goodness, and one gave her beauty rare;<br />
One gave her sweetest singing voice; one, gracious mien and air;<br />
One, skill in dancing; one, all cleverness; and then the crone<br />
Came forth, and muttered, angry still, and good gift gave she none;<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 750px;">
<img src="images/img1.jpg" width="750" height="497" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class="cpoem"><p>
But said, that in the future years the Princess young should die,<br />
By pricking of a spindle-point&mdash;ah, woeful prophecy!<br />
But now, a kind young Fairy, who had waited to the last,<br />
Stepped forth, and said, &ldquo;No, she shall sleep till a hundred years are past;<br />
And then she shall be wakened by a King's son&mdash;truth I tell&mdash;<br />
And he will take her for his wife, and all will yet be well.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
In vain in all her father's Court the spinning-wheel's forbid<br />
In vain in all the country-side the spindles sharp are hid;<br />
For in a lonely turret high, and up a winding stair,<br />
There lives an ancient woman who still turns her wheel with care.<br />
The Princess found her out one day, and tried to learn to spin;<br />
Alas! the spindle pricked her hand&mdash;the charm had entered in!<br />
<br />
And down she falls in death-like sleep: they lay her on her bed,<br />
And all around her sink to rest&mdash;a palace of the dead!<br />
A hundred years pass&mdash;still they sleep, and all around the place<br />
A wood of thorns has risen up&mdash;no path a man can trace.<br />
At last, a King's son, in the hunt, asked how long it had stood,<br />
And what old towers were those he saw above the ancient wood.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/illus-0013-1.jpg" width="491" height="650" alt="" title="THE SLEEPING BEAUTY" />
</div>

<div class="cpoem"><p>
An aged peasant told of an enchanted palace, where<br />
A sleeping King and Court lay hid, and sleeping Princess fair.<br />
Through the thick wood, that gave him way, and past the thorns that drew<br />
Their sharpest points another way, the King's son presses through.<br />
He reached the guard, the court, the hall,&mdash;and there, where'er he stept,<br />
He saw the sentinels, and grooms, and courtiers as they slept.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 493px;">
<img src="images/illus-0016-1.jpg" width="493" height="650" alt="" title="THE SLEEPING BEAUTY" />
</div>

<div class="cpoem"><p>
Ladies in act to smile, and pages in attendance wait;<br />
The horses slept within their stalls, the dogs about the gate.<br />
The King's son presses on, into an inner chamber fair,<br />
And sees, laid on a silken bed, a lovely lady there;<br />
So sweet a face, so fair&mdash;was never beauty such as this;<br />
He stands&mdash;he stoops to gaze&mdash;he kneels&mdash;he wakes her with a kiss.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 492px;">
<img src="images/illus-0017-1.jpg" width="492" height="650" alt="" title="THE SLEEPING BEAUTY" />
</div>

<div class="cpoem"><p>
He leads her forth: the magic sleep of all the Court is o'er,&mdash;<br />
They wake, they move, they talk, they laugh, just as they did of yore<br />
A hundred years ago. The King and Queen awake, and tell<br />
How all has happed, rejoicing much that all has ended well.<br />
They hold the wedding that same day, with mirth and feasting good&mdash;<br />
The wedding of the Prince and Sleeping Beauty in the Wood.<br />

<h2><i>BLUEBEARD.</i></h2>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/illus-0036-1.jpg" width="491" height="650" alt="" title="BLUEBEARD." />
</div>

<div class="cpoem"><p>
Once on a time there lived a man hated by all he knew,<br />
Both that his ways were very bad, and that his beard was blue;<br />
But as he was so rich and grand, and led a merry life,<br />
A lady he contrived at last to induce to be his wife.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 493px;">
<img src="images/illus-0037-1.jpg" width="493" height="650" alt="" title="BLUEBEARD." />
</div>

<div class="cpoem"><p>
For a month after the wedding they lived and had good cheer,<br />
And then said Bluebeard to his wife, &ldquo;I'll say good-bye, my dear;<br />
Indeed, it is but for six weeks that I shall be away,<br />
I beg that you'll invite your friends, and feast and dance and play;<br />
And all my property I'll leave confided to your care.<br />
Here are the keys of all my chests, there's plenty and to spare.&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 492px;">
<img src="images/illus-0040-1.jpg" width="492" height="650" alt="" title="BLUEBEARD." />
</div>

<div class="cpoem"><p>
&ldquo;But this small key belongs to one small room on the ground-floor,&mdash;<br />
And this you must not open, or you will repent it sore.&rdquo;<br />
And so he went; and all the friends came there from far and wide,<br />
And in her wealth the lady took much happiness and pride;<br />
But in a while this kind of joy grew nearly satisfied.<br />
</p></div>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus-0042-1.jpg" width="650" height="429" alt="" title="BLUEBEARD." />
</div>


<div class="cpoem"><p>
And oft she saw the closet door, and longed to look inside.<br />
At last she could no more refrain, and turned the little key,<br />
And looked within, and fainted straight the horrid sight to see;<br />
For there upon the floor was blood, and on the walls were wives,<br />
For Bluebeard first had married them, then cut their throats with knives.<br />
<br />
And this poor wife, distracted, picked the key up from the floor,<br />
All stained with blood; and with much fear she shut and locked the door.<br />
She tried in vain to clean the key and wash the stain away<br />
With sand and soap,&mdash;it was no use. Bluebeard came back that day;<br />
At once he asked her for the key,&mdash;he saw the bloody stain.&mdash;<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 501px;">
<img src="images/illus-0044-1.jpg" width="501" height="650" alt="" title="BLUEBEARD." />
</div>

<div class="cpoem"><p>
&ldquo;<i>You have been in the closet once, and you shall go again!</i>&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;O spare me, spare me! give me time, nor kill me hastily!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You have a quarter of an hour,&mdash;then, madam, you must die!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;O sister Anne, go up, go up, and look out from the tower;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I'm dead unless my brothers come in a quarter of an hour!&rdquo;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.3em;">And Anne looked once, and Anne looked twice, and nothing saw abroad,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.3em;">But shining sun and growing grass, and dust upon the road.</span><br />
</p></div>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
